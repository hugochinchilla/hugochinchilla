### Hi there üëã

If you want to see the kind of code I write here there are some of my favorite examples:
 - [pysyringe](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/pysyringe) A production ready dependency injection container for python
 - [lifeboat_linux](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/lifeboat_linux) An extensible linux distro in a single EFI file for recovering damaged systems
 - [hr_assignment](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/hr_assignment) A simple HR app I coded as a code challenge for a company I applied to
 - [Rover kata](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/wallbox-rover-kata) A rover kata also developed as a code challenge for another company
 - [backpack kata](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/backpack-kata-2020) A TDD exercise applying some aspects of Domain Driven Design
 - [botanist](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/botanist) A PHP package for avoiding mixed ownerships in a project tree when running docker as root (which you should not)

Also I co-authored this other two repositories. It was a way to bootstrap a new team operating in full remote, aiming to stablish team agreements about how we should operate and how the architecture for a new project should look like, once we had a good grasp on it we moved to the actual project. Work was done in mob-programming so commit author is not too much meaningful, just an indicator of who was using the keyboard at any given time.
