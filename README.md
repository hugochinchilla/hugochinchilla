### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's been a while since I created a personal project here, if you want to take a look at code that actually represents my current coding style look at [this kata](https://github.com/hugochinchilla/backpack-kata-2020).

Also I co-authored this other two repositories. It was a way to bootstrap a new team operating in full remote and stablish team agreements about how we should operate and how the architecture for a new project should look like, once we had a good grasp on it we moved to the actual project. Work was done in mob-programming so commit author is not too much meaningful, just an indicator of who was using the keyboard at any given time.
